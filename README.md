# Application of Partial Least Square and Principal Component Regression in Multicollinearity
 The Boston Housing Dataset, widely used in regression analysis and machine learning, presents challenges such as multicollinearity among variables like RAD (index of highway accessibility) and TAX (property tax rate). To address this, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied, reducing dimensionality while retaining 90% of the variance in seven principal components. These components capture diverse urban characteristics, including urbanization, residential quality, environmental aspects, spatial housing features, demographic diversity, and the inverse relationship between crime rates and industrial presence.  Using these components, Principal Component Regression (PCR) achieved an RÂ² of 55%, demonstrating strong performance for an unsupervised approach. Extending to Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) by including all components further improved model interpretability and predictive power.
